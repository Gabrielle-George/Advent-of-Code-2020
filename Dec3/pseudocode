pseudocode:

.#.#.#....#..........#.........


x_cursor = 0
y_cursor = 0
while y_cursor <num lines:
	tree? x_cursor, y_cursor
	increment step: x_cursor + 3
					y_cursor + 1
BUT needs to be:
					(x_cursor+3) MOD 31

so if we were at the 29, and need to go to the next step,
it should rollover to the next line and be

29+3 = 32 so the new cursor should be at 1
